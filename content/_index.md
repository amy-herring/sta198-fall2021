As well, Amy will attend Wednesday lecture sessions and Amy will attend Friday sections. Additional instructor office hours are available by appointment.

### Topics covered

We will cover a variety of topics in statistical and data science and their application in the following contexts.

- global patterns of obesity in rural and urban regions
- murdered and missing indigenous women
- tobacco use
- mercury exposure in the Peruvian Amazon
- men's health gap
- COVID-19 testing and treatment

In addition, each student will participate in a group that will conduct a case study project of their own interest.

**To develop your skills as a practicing health data scientist, throughout the course you will:**

- gain skills in reproducible research and programming, including version-control and collaboration via GitHub,
- critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of recent real-world data,
- express statistical models clearly and correctly, 
- develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers and the general public, and
- effectively and concisely communicate results to allied researchers and the general public.
