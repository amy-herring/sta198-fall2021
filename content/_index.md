title: "STA 198 / GLHLTH 298: Introduction to Global Health Data Science"
description: "STA 198 / GLHLTH 298 is an intensive applied course that provides a rigorous introduction to health data science using current applications in global health research. This course focuses on use of the R computing environment to conduct reproducible data exploration, visualization, and analysis. Students will interpret and translate results for interdisciplinary researchers and the public. Students practice critical evaluation of data-based claims, decisions, and policies. The course includes exploratory data analysis, visualization, basics of probability and inference, predictive modeling, and classification."

As well, Amy will attend Wednesday lecture sessions and Amy will attend Friday sections. Additional instructor office hours are available by appointment.

### Resources

Given the widespread availability of relevant information on the internet, it is not necessary to purchase a book for the course, though I will suggest useful readings regularly.

- [OpenIntro Statistics](https://www.openintro.org/book/os/) by Diez, Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Barr is an outstanding (free!) resource.

- [Seeing Theory](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu) is an amazing interactive project by Kunin, Guo, Devlin, and Jiang. 

- My favorite biostatistics text is [Principles of Biostatistics](https://www.routledge.com/Principles-of-Biostatistics/Pagano-Gauvreau/p/book/9781138593145?gclid=CjwKCAjwz_WGBhA1EiwAUAxIcVtyaN5gVRe0QtFY32GZu5_VCRSH5nN3xgdoZo5X4VxIDi1WEhF8UxoC1CEQAvD_BwE) by Pagano and Gauvreau. Their exposition is excellent, and they have very nice worked examples throughout. The challenge right now is that the 2nd edition only contains code in Stata, and the 3rd edition (with R code) is not quite out. This book is on reserve at Perkins Library.

### Topics covered

We will cover a variety of topics in statistical and data science and their application in the following contexts.

- global patterns of obesity in rural and urban regions
- murdered and missing indigenous women
- tobacco use
- mercury exposure in the Peruvian Amazon
- men's health gap
- COVID-19 testing and treatment
- other important global health topics (including some chosen by you for course projects)

In addition, each student will participate in a group that will conduct a case study project of their own interest.

**To develop your skills as a practicing health data scientist, throughout the course you will:**

- gain skills in reproducible research and programming, including version-control and collaboration via GitHub,
- critically think about reasonable analysis approaches in the context of recent real-world data,
- express statistical models clearly and correctly, 
- develop scientific writing skills by providing clear, concise, data-driven 
conclusions suitable for allied researchers and the general public, and
- effectively and concisely communicate results to allied researchers and the general public.
