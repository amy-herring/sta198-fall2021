This course recognizes the extraordinary circumstances that many students may be facing and have created the course policies and schedule to help reduce stress and promote effective course mastery. If you find that anything is affecting your wellbeing or academic success and you find it difficult to complete your work, please let me and your Academic Deans know as soon as possible. We are happy to work with you to make sure you succeed in STA 198L. You may also find additional information regarding personal emergencies [here](https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/personal-emergencies).

### Diversity and Inclusion

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated; please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this, if you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your Academic Dean is an excellent resource. I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.

### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is of paramount importance in this class, and all work must be done in accordance with the Duke Community Standard, reproduced as follows:

To uphold the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard):
- I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
- I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
- I will act if the Standard is compromised.

By enrolling in this course, you have agreed to abide by and uphold the provisions of the [Duke Community Standard](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct/about-us/duke-community-standard) as well as the policies specific to this course. Cheating or plagiarism on assignments, lying about an illness or absence and other forms of academic dishonesty are a breach of trust with classmates and faculty, violate this Standard, and will not be tolerated; any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment, be reported to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action, and potentially a failing (F) course grade depending on the magnitude of the offense.

Occasionally, data sets we are privileged to use in class are confidential and cannot be distributed more broadly or without express permission from the data-granting sponsor. Any unauthorized dissemination *or further use* of these data sets beyond this class is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. 

**Reusing code**: You are welcome to use online resources (e.g. StackOverflow). If you use code from an outside source, either directly or as inspiration, you *must explicitly cite* where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism and a violation of the Duke Community Standard. 

On individual assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.

### Activities & Assessments

#### Class Participation (5%)

Attendance at lectures is strongly encouraged. Graded activities during lectures will be used to encourage attendance, and these activities will comprise the course participation grade. The lowest 4 participation grades will be dropped.

#### Homework (15%)

Eight (8) graded homework assignments focus on understanding methods, performing data analysis, and reinforcing concepts from lecture. Feel free to discuss homework with other students -- however, all work must be your own. Homework assignments must be typed as an R Markdown document and uploaded to Gradescope and linked to a private GitHub repository prior to the due date in order to receive credit. Unlimited resubmissions are allowed until the due date. Only the final version will be graded.

No late homework is accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically.

#### Labs (15%)

Six (6) graded labs focus on computing tools needed to tackle analysis of real-world data sets and may be individual or team-based. No late labs are accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically.  Unlimited resubmissions are allowed until the due date. Only the final version will be graded.

No late labs are accepted, but the lowest grade will be dropped automatically.


**Note:** An individual team member’s grade will be modified on these or other assignments if peer evaluations indicate this is appropriate.

#### In-Class Exams (50%)

Two midterms (10%, 20%) and a final exam (20%) test understanding, analysis, and interpretation of methods. During exams, students are not permitted to communicate or collaborate with anyone regarding the exam (except the professor). 

Exam dates cannot be changed, and no make-ups will be given. In the case of illness or other extenuating circumstances, contact Prof. Herring as soon as possible to make plans.

### Project (15%)

The final research project is an open-ended statistical analysis that answers a research question of interest using a real-world data set. The project will involve a final written analysis report as well as an oral presentation. Additional details will be provided throughout the semester.

No late projects are accepted.

#### Grade Calculation

The grading basis for this class is a traditional letter grade unless requested otherwise according to the standard university policy. The following table presents the contribution of each component to a student's final grade:
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-left}
 <span></span>     | <span></span>  
-----------|---------------------------------
Participation (individual) | 5%
Homework (group) | 15%
Labs | 15%
Project | 15%
Exam 1 | 15%
Exam 2 | 15%
Final Exam | 20%

A letter grade will be assigned as follows:  
 
{.table .table2 .table-condensed .table-striped .text-center}
<span></span>     | <span></span>     | <span></span>    | <span></span>    |  <span></span>      
----|----|----|----|----
93 | &le; | A  | &le; | 100
90 | &le; | A- | &lt; | 93 
87 | &le; | B+ | &lt; | 90
83 | &le; | B  | &lt; | 87
80 | &le; | B- | &lt; | 83 
77 | &le; | C+ | &lt; | 80
73 | &le; | C  | &lt; | 77 
70 | &le; | C- | &lt; | 73 
67 | &le; | D+ | &lt; | 70
63 | &le; | D  | &lt; | 67 
60 | &le; | D- | &lt; | 63 
0  | &le; | F  | &lt; | 60 

I never "curve down." These posted cut points are guaranteed minimums. As well, this course is not graded to a pre-specified distribution; if every student earns a 95 in the course, then every student will receive an A. I reserve the right to "curve up" using more generous cut points depending on overall difficulty of assessments.

Regrade requests must be made within two days of when a report is returned. These will be honored if points were tallied incorrectly, or if you feel part of your report is correct, but it was marked wrong (these things do happen!). No regrade will be made to alter the number of points deducted for an issue. When a regrade request is evaluated, if new errors are identified, additional points may be deducted from the grade.

### Accessibility

Duke University is committed to providing equal access to students with documented disabilities. Students with disabilities may contact the [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](http://access.duke.edu) to ensure your access to this course and to the program. There you can engage in a confidential conversation about the process for requesting reasonable accommodations both in the classroom and in clinical settings. Students are encouraged to register with the SDAO as soon as they begin the program. **Note that accommodations are not provided retroactively.**
